# supervised_learning_analysis

This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict the revenue and success of cross-selling promotion using the data set of an online foos and meals business.

Predicting Revenues using Linear Regression:
1. Loading data and libraries
2. Feature engineering for: email reclassification, log transformations, online behavior reclassifications.
3. Spliting dataset into training and testing
4. Runing linear regression models using SciKit - Learn: OLS, LASSO, ARD, KNN (estimating/ using different optimal number of neighbors)
5. Model comparison
6. Model recommendation and model summary

Predicting Cross selling promotion sucess:
1. Loading data, libraries and user defined functions
2. Feature engineering for: email reclassification, log transformations, online behavior reclassifications.
3. Spliting dataset into training and testing
4.  Runing linear regression models using SciKit - Learn: 
    Logistic regression and hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression,
    Classification tree and hyperparameter tuning for for Classification Tree,
    Pruned Tree and hyperparameter tuning for Pruned Tree,
    KNN with optimal number of neihbors,
